hello = '''
Hello there, I'm redblackcatt, a C, C++, and Python developer.
I like to make programs like these:

1. Simple games, like Tic-Tac-Toe or Poker.
2. Make super cool Homebrew apps for the 3DS.
3. Take simple program requests!

However, it is important to note I'm not exactly an expert!
I'm just here for fun! :)

See you!
